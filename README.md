 a finder the notes within a specific chord
A chord finder

This is a HTML code that helps you find chords based on note names. The code uses a drop-down menu to select the notes, and then displays the corresponding chords below.

How to use

To use the chord finder, first add the HTML code to your website. Once you have added the code, you can click the "Find Chord" button to open the drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, you can select the notes you want to use to create a chord.

After you have selected the notes, the corresponding chords will be displayed below. The chords are displayed in the order of their root notes, from lowest to highest.

Future improvements

I plan to improve the chord finder in the future with the following enhancements:

Add more chords: I plan to add more chords to the chord finder, so that it can be used with a wider range of music genres.
Add a piano view: I plan to add a piano view to the chord finder, so that users can see the notes on a piano keyboard.
Add a sound feature: I plan to add a sound feature to the chord finder, so that users can hear how the chords sound.

Here are some additional details you can include in your README file:

How to select the notes:
Specify that you use a drop-down menu to select the notes.

These additional details will make your README file more complete and informative.

I hope this README file helps you promote your project.**

Additional suggestions:

You could add a section to the README file that explains the different types of chords. This would be helpful for users who are not familiar with music theory.
You could also add a section that provides examples of how to use the chord finder. This would be helpful for users who are just getting started.
I hope these suggestions are helpful.
