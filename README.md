Finder of notes in a specific chord

This is a HTML code that find notes based on chords. The code uses a drop-down menu to select the notes, and then displays the corresponding notes below.

How to use

To use the chord finder, first add the HTML code to your website. Once you have added the code, you can click the "Find Chord" button to open the drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, you can select the chords you want to learn notes inside that chord. Then the corresponding notes will be displayed below.

Future improvements
 I plan to improve the chord finder in the future with the following enhancements:
    
        Add more chords: I plan to add more chords to the chord finder, so that it can be used with a wider range of music genres.
        Add a piano view: I plan to add a piano view to the chord finder, so that users can see the notes on a piano keyboard.
        Add a sound feature: I plan to add a sound feature to the chord finder, so that users can hear how the chords sound.
